üîç HCCDA Lab: Installing and Configuring DeepSeak using KoohLab
This lab was developed as part of the HCCDA (Huawei Certified ICT Associate - Data Communication) certification, using the KoohLab virtual environment. The goal was to deploy and configure DeepSeak, a powerful network visibility and threat detection tool, in a simulated enterprise network.

üõ†Ô∏è Lab Objectives:
Understand the role of DeepSeak in network security monitoring

Deploy DeepSeak in a virtualized lab environment

Configure traffic flow to allow DeepSeak to capture and analyze data

Validate threat visibility and dashboard reports

‚úÖ Steps Involved:
1. Environment Setup in KoohLab
Logged into the KoohLab platform provided by HCCDA training.

Selected the DeepSeak lab template or manually built a topology with:

1 Router

1 Switch

1 Windows/Linux PC (target system)

1 DeepSeak server (installed on a virtual machine)

2. DeepSeak Installation
Accessed the DeepSeak VM via remote console or SSH.

Updated the system packages and installed dependencies.

Ran the DeepSeak installation script or package (provided in the lab).

Verified that DeepSeak services (sensor, dashboard, and collector) were running.

3. Network Traffic Mirroring Configuration
Configured port mirroring on the virtual switch to send a copy of all traffic from the target PC to the DeepSeak server.

Used KoohLab's virtual switch CLI or GUI to configure SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer).

4. Traffic Generation for Testing
From the target PC, generated simulated traffic:

Ping, browsing activity, file transfer

Simulated malware or port scanning using tools like nmap or test files

5. DeepSeak Dashboard Verification
Logged into the DeepSeak web dashboard.

Monitored real-time data:

Packet analysis

Alerts and suspicious behavior

Source/destination IPs, protocols, bandwidth usage

#6. Reporting and Observations#
Took screenshots of alerts and traffic analytics

Noted how DeepSeak responded to suspicious traffic

Generated a sample report from the dashboard

üìå Learning Outcomes:
Gained practical skills in traffic analysis and network monitoring

Understood how to integrate a security monitoring tool like DeepSeak into a live network

Experienced configuring port mirroring, packet collection, and alert validation
